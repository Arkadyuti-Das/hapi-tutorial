Introduction to plugins
========================
If it's a hapi plugin we need to register it with our server. 
options allow us to customize how the plugin works.

(Worked with hapi-geo-locate plugin)
npm i hapi-geo-locate

Serving static files
====================
(inert
A plugin that provides new handler methods for serving static files and directories)
npm install @hapi/inert

note-
handler says what to do,
options say how to do it or gives extra information about the route.

If I am using h.file to any other route other than the specified one, it won't be able to find it.
So for that I need to set that up on the server. 
So instead of using "options", we would use "routes" in the server and the same thing would follow it.

inert also lets us to download files as well as display them.
Setting the mode to "attachment" makes the file become a download as opposed to being displayed.

Working with forms
===================
<input type="text" name="username"> is accessed in hapi by the name attribute as -
request.payload.username

Always remember the handler method must return a value.
